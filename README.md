# Assignment 1: Agent Based Modelling 

## Outline

For this assignment I have built an agent based model which models sheep living in a field, eating grass and being relentlessly slaughtered by a rabid, insatiable wolf. The code reads in a digital elevation model which the sheep live on, and the sheep proceed to move around eating grass, sharing with sheep in their area. The sharing algorithm implemented ensures fair sharing regardless of the listed order of the agents by having a separate list of the shares going to each agent which are only shared out at the end of each iteration. 

The parameters of the model include: 

- The number of agents (sheep)
- The number of iterations
- The walking speed of the sheep when not hunted 
- The wolf's speed
- The 'neighbourhood' -  the distance within which sheep will share their store with other sheep
